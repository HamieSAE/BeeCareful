Dear Future Programmer, 
Hope you are well,

I am leaving this file to help you with picking up where I left off:

tbh I haven't done much...

I've made a Scene called Mechanics for prototyping.

The "Player" in the hierarchy is there to hold the position of the player and the related objects. [The Green One]
	PlayerBee is where all the scripts related to the player attached, specifically the Movement script that relies on the character controller.[The Blue One]

For the Camera/View rotation, the script is attached to the Camera. 

The rest are expendable and feel free to get rid of them, most of them were to see how the animation, texturing and such work. 

Partical system is just stretch goal for now.

=====>>  What you need to do from now on...  <<=====

Tommaso has a Backlog, feel free to continue from 3rd task onwards

The most important is the collision between the bee/player and the flower to activate the flower and its pollens animation. 
Its a simple collision script with anim. 

And what comes after is dependant on Tommaso and the teams direction.

Good Luck
hope you make a bee-you-tea-ful game!

Have Fun ^_^)/
